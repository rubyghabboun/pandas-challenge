In this project, Schools are grouped into two types ( Charter and District ).
The combined student population in these schools is 39,170.
The total budget for all schools is approximately $24.65 million.

Charter schools have higher overall passing rates compared to District schools.
we can see the top performing schools, all are Charter schools, and among the bottom performing schools, all are District schools.
The top performing schools have overall passing rates above 95%, while the bottom performing schools have overall passing rates below 75%.

The average math score across all students is about 78.98, and the average reading score is approximately 81.88.
Around 74.98% of students are passing math (scoring 70 or higher), and 85.81% are passing reading.

Generally, math and reading scores are consistent across all provided grade levels. There is no significant change in scores between grades 9 to 12

Schools with higher spending per student do not necessarily have higher average test scores or passing rates.
and schools in the "spending range" of "$585-630" per student tend to have the highest overall passing rates.
This suggests that higher spending does not guarantee better performance and that there may be wasting returns on investment.

School size, budget per student, and school type can be factors influencing performance.
Also, Charter schools are consistently outperforming District schools
